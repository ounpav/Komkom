WEBVTT

01:07.526 --> 01:11.738
I'm Chernang, king of all the bandits
here at Garuda Wing Cliff.

01:18.913 --> 01:22.124
My blood is not for your sword to drink.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.133
The man in black in front of you

01:31.259 --> 01:32.926
was the one who killed your father.

01:33.511 --> 01:36.429
I was the one
who slashed your father's throat.

02:19.348 --> 02:23.726
Let me repay your father's life with mine,

02:23.852 --> 02:25.979
my dear son.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.361
Chernang.

03:25.164 --> 03:28.333
According to the rules of this land,

03:28.459 --> 03:31.711
all his rights have been revoked.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.175
This rebel shall receive
thirteen punishments,

03:37.968 --> 03:39.886
until he no longer breathes.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.093
Start the punishment.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.834
Crush every bit of his bones.

05:39.465 --> 05:42.049
Let him follow his father to hell.

09:23.146 --> 09:26.608
Add one part medicinal plant
to three parts salt.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.985
Don't forget to put in some peppers.

09:37.495 --> 09:40.079
Don't worry, the angels will protect you.

09:40.205 --> 09:43.416
You'll get well soon.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.130
Hey. Take a look at each patient.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.674
Why do they seem
to have similar symptoms?

09:51.800 --> 09:55.928
Didn't you hear what they said?
They were cursed.

09:57.222 --> 10:01.434
I see. That's why Master Bua
made a pilgrimage to break the curse.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.646
The curse. The curse.

10:04.772 --> 10:09.108
Hey, Men, go away. Go away.

10:09.234 --> 10:13.070
I wasn't making any trouble.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.264
Tien.

12:06.268 --> 12:09.020
You must come back, Tien.

12:09.146 --> 12:12.899
Who will I play with if you're gone?

12:19.615 --> 12:23.242
I won't let you go. I won't let you go.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.470
I curse you.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.766
You will meet a miserable end.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.019
I curse you.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.523
You will meet a miserable end.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.402
I curse you.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.490
You will meet a miserable end.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.328
Let this decree be uttered
with these sacred words,

15:54.454 --> 15:58.207
in front of all the gods
gathered here today

15:59.417 --> 16:03.838
who bear witness to this holy ritual.

16:05.173 --> 16:10.302
May the gods protect all
who stay loyal to me.

16:12.472 --> 16:17.143
But anyone who ever thinks
of betraying me and this land,

16:18.186 --> 16:22.731
shall be cursed
to meet with a miserable fate

16:22.858 --> 16:26.360
and shall be tormented forever.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.596
I curse you.

16:55.515 --> 16:59.852
You will meet a miserable end.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.855
I curse you.

19:43.725 --> 19:49.896
You are a great fighter
like no other.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.318
Come work for me.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.279
And I will grant you
everything you wish for.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.492
What royal grace
you've bestowed upon me.

20:02.619 --> 20:06.955
But there is nothing I desire,
Your Highness.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.718
Take your reward.

20:21.804 --> 20:25.682
You are not in any position
to negotiate.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.603
You're just a crow.

20:29.729 --> 20:33.065
How dare you negotiate
with a King Garuda like me?

20:34.609 --> 20:37.153
Have you been having
nightmares lately?

20:38.988 --> 20:40.447
The curse in the nightmare

20:41.533 --> 20:44.826
will haunt you for the rest of your life.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.455
I know who put the curse on you.

20:53.961 --> 20:58.549
Only I can break that curse.

21:01.303 --> 21:06.140
You must come to me.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.527
Cut off this rebel's head tomorrow.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.180
Executioner.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.683
Kill him.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.346
Halt the execution.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.650
By Royal Decree. . .

23:27.490 --> 23:29.991
. . . I have come to take
this prisoner from death row. . .

23:31.077 --> 23:34.330
. . .by the command
of the King of Ayothaya.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.478
How could Ayothaya do this to me?

24:01.316 --> 24:05.486
I believe there must be a traitor

24:09.115 --> 24:11.199
who has been plotting
against Your Highness.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.622
Rest assured, Your Highness.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.750
I have sent the assassins

24:19.876 --> 24:21.752
to take care of this matter.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.452
I curse you. . .

25:05.463 --> 25:07.423
You will meet a miserable end.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.954
Bring the injured in here. Quickly.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.418
Please heal this man.

26:29.964 --> 26:31.465
This way.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.594
Quickly. Give me a hand.

26:38.014 --> 26:41.433
Quickly. Bring me some medicine,
water and clean clothes.

27:00.495 --> 27:04.372
This sword is for my father,
Lord Sihadecho.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.850
Get the rebel's head.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.644
How dare you?

28:28.207 --> 28:29.332
My Lord.

29:49.872 --> 29:52.248
Do we still have any hope?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.127
Tien was born under an ominous sign.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.798
What he did in a past life

29:59.924 --> 30:02.175
causes him to suffer in this life.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.677
The corporeal body

30:03.803 --> 30:06.805
is still waiting for the mind
to be free of wrath.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.058
Wandering around,

30:10.852 --> 30:13.019
fending off the revenge of karma.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.237
I'll have to try

30:23.155 --> 30:25.115
to alleviate his tortured fate.

30:33.666 --> 30:37.168
If we could unite the power
of our minds.

30:40.297 --> 30:42.257
to create a symbol of faith,

30:44.176 --> 30:46.511
in order to prolong his life.

30:47.847 --> 30:53.769
The merit created might please
the enemies of his past life

30:53.895 --> 30:59.941
clearing the path for his tormented
soul to get back to its body.

31:03.404 --> 31:06.197
I give you everything.

34:39.661 --> 34:42.705
Oh, he's alive.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.958
He woke up.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.293
He woke up. He's alive.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.337
See? He's alive.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.272
Anyone who thinks of betraying me

35:11.152 --> 35:17.991
shall be cursed
to receive a miserable fate forever.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.667
Don't worry, Tien.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.086
You're much better now.

35:31.588 --> 35:33.089
It won't be long.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.304
It won't be long
until we can dance together, Tien.

37:17.153 --> 37:19.070
Go away.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.781
Get out.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.227
Are you crying?

40:38.354 --> 40:39.687
I'll go with you.

40:39.813 --> 40:42.189
Go. Go away.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.489
Are you crying?

40:51.283 --> 40:52.908
Go. Go away.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.715
Oh, it's high.

41:10.302 --> 41:14.805
You want me to jump?
OK, I'll jump with you.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.224
Go ahead. Quickly.

41:17.351 --> 41:19.935
Huh? Quickly. Let's go.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.647
Ha. I'll go with you.

41:29.488 --> 41:32.532
Oh, wow. It's high.
It's high, huh?

41:33.867 --> 41:35.618
I said go away.

41:36.662 --> 41:37.828
Go away.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.166
I've changed my mind.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.170
Let's get back.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.507
Go away. Get out.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.843
Don't cry.

41:53.929 --> 41:55.555
Laugh. We should laugh.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.143
Get back.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.815
Get back. Come on.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.362
Go ahead and jump.
He's not going to follow you.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.367
Hey. He hasn't got any hair.

42:18.495 --> 42:20.663
Right now, an insane person like Men

42:20.789 --> 42:23.999
could understand the world better
than a sane person like you.

42:25.669 --> 42:28.003
Staying here is better than jumping.

42:34.511 --> 42:37.680
I'm at my wits' end.

42:38.599 --> 42:42.226
I'm alive, yet my life is worthless.

42:44.563 --> 42:49.108
You were born with an ominous fate
that causes your suffering.

42:58.076 --> 43:02.246
But now, my name
cannot help rectify my fate.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.923
I can't accept having to live like this.

43:15.427 --> 43:19.597
Your name only symbolises
its meaning: light.

43:21.141 --> 43:22.683
Tien. . .

43:23.560 --> 43:26.937
. . .take a look in front of you now.

43:40.577 --> 43:43.663
The light of wisdom
is driving away the darkness.

43:45.791 --> 43:47.625
Look at the ground.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.963
Now you can see your own shadow.

43:56.510 --> 44:00.638
If you have been scared by the shadow
that's been following you,

44:00.764 --> 44:03.558
just remember,

44:03.684 --> 44:09.522
wherever the shadow is,
the light is always nearby.

44:23.745 --> 44:25.204
Father,

44:27.040 --> 44:29.041
what should I do now?

44:30.919 --> 44:34.839
Follow me. Seek solitude.
Practice meditation.

44:40.721 --> 44:43.013
Enlighten your mind.

45:17.883 --> 45:21.051
Tien, why do you want
to use weapons?

45:24.765 --> 45:27.099
I want to be a great warrior
like my father.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.559
Your father is a great warrior.

45:28.685 --> 45:33.648
But that didn't help him
to find peace in his life.

45:41.990 --> 45:43.949
Father.

45:45.952 --> 45:48.829
A weapon is a tangible form of power.

45:54.127 --> 45:57.755
Anyone who can fuse
his body and soul with it

45:58.882 --> 46:01.759
shall possess the greatest power
in the land.

46:03.720 --> 46:06.471
Do you think great warriors

46:06.598 --> 46:09.349
can bring peace to their homeland?

46:10.185 --> 46:11.435
Chernang.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.063
Leave me alone.

46:17.317 --> 46:20.402
I'm at wits' end.

46:22.823 --> 46:26.200
Tien, your name means "candle."
It's a symbol of light in Buddhism.

46:27.035 --> 46:29.787
Light means wisdom,

46:30.872 --> 46:34.333
that eradicates
the darkness of ignorance.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.418
The benightedness of the mind.

46:39.923 --> 46:44.426
Wisdom helps bring enduring peace
to this world.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.572
I've brought you

49:16.579 --> 49:18.080
a pretty lady.

49:18.790 --> 49:19.957
Do you want her?

51:04.229 --> 51:06.021
I can dance alone.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.395
What are they doing?

52:29.647 --> 52:31.190
I know.

52:40.408 --> 52:44.744
Now I understand
what your intention was,

52:45.746 --> 52:48.415
why you taught me the arts of dancing.

52:49.709 --> 52:51.626
It's therapy for the body and mind.

53:00.178 --> 53:02.637
I owe you a depth of gratitude
for changing my life.

53:04.182 --> 53:06.600
It's your mind
that's finally opened to change.

53:06.726 --> 53:09.603
Change the enemies
into dancing partners.

53:12.523 --> 53:15.192
There are many things in this world
that you have yet to learn.

53:16.152 --> 53:20.864
Greed. Wrath. Infatuation.
Desires. Lust. . . and ignorance.

53:22.117 --> 53:23.575
Always be careful.

53:24.369 --> 53:28.830
These sins are the causes of suffering.

53:28.956 --> 53:31.416
They cause all living creatures
to be stuck

53:31.542 --> 53:33.835
in the perpetual cycle
of birth and death.

53:36.297 --> 53:38.548
How can I stop these sins?

53:39.550 --> 53:41.426
Through training.

53:41.552 --> 53:45.430
You need to train yourself to cleanse

53:46.432 --> 53:49.101
and purify deep into your mind.

53:51.104 --> 53:52.687
The mind is the chief.

53:52.813 --> 53:54.231
The body is the servant.

53:57.402 --> 54:00.320
The consciousness is the controller.

54:01.281 --> 54:03.198
The mind comprehends.

54:03.991 --> 54:05.534
Be aware,

54:05.660 --> 54:07.077
then let go.

54:07.203 --> 54:09.329
Your mind will remain untarnished.

57:33.701 --> 57:39.373
My castle welcomes only you,
Your Highness.

57:40.708 --> 57:42.000
Stay here.

58:44.146 --> 58:48.858
I'm honoured that
you have paid me a visit.

59:13.926 --> 59:15.218
What do you really want?

59:15.886 --> 59:20.139
Power, and everything you own.

59:24.729 --> 59:27.230
I curse you.

01:00:15.488 --> 01:00:18.865
The power. . . is mine.

01:00:29.919 --> 01:00:31.210
Kill him.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:49.539
All of you. Go inside to kill him.
He must not live.

01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:09.744
Power should be possessed
by ones who deserve it.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:15.541
You wicked crow. Traitor.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.858
I curse you.

01:03:39.984 --> 01:03:43.111
You will meet a miserable end.

01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:46.114
Miserable end.

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.574
Miserable. . .

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:50.159
. . .end.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.191
Submit yourselves to me.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.195
I am your king now.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.953
You have a guest.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:43.291
Come on.

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:45.251
Here he is.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:47.962
Don't be shy.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.298
Over there.

01:06:53.093 --> 01:06:54.427
Capture him.

01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:56.220
Capture me?

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.264
What did I do wrong?

01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:07.440
Oh, a lot of people.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:35.343
I stamped on your foot.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.512
And I'm taking it off.

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:59.242
Your nose is bleeding.
Your mouth too.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.205
Don't pull it out.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.261
Oh, there's a rope.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:20.554
Let me play too.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.149
Got it.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.822
Must have broken his balls.

01:08:41.035 --> 01:08:43.618
Oh, the same rope.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.335
Oh, where are you going?

01:12:59.501 --> 01:13:01.835
You are the chosen one

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:04.838
to fight and drive away ignorance.

01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:33.654
Stop your evil acts.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:54.299
Finally, you have come.

01:16:00.765 --> 01:16:02.391
I'm here to stop you.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:06.562
You want to stop me?

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:16.989
There is no way you can stop me.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.950
Look.

01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:23.621
None of your mighty gods

01:16:24.831 --> 01:16:28.459
can withstand my power.

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:46.894
I can smell

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:53.567
the grudge and vengefulness in you.

01:16:56.446 --> 01:16:57.863
No. No.

01:16:59.574 --> 01:17:02.451
Let me go.

01:17:06.498 --> 01:17:09.082
Let me go. Tien.

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:21.595
Your life

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.474
belongs to me.

01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:39.321
Tien.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:44.159
Your life is coming to an end.

01:17:45.954 --> 01:17:48.497
You can't escape it.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.220
No.

01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:09.317
I feed off the grudge
and vengefulness in your heart.

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:13.405
You can never overcome me.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.042
I have come from emptiness.

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:28.128
I shall return to emptiness.

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:41.016
You can't escape it.
